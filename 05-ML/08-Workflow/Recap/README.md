## Recap - Workflow (Pipeline and ColumnTransformer)

❓How to keep track of the one-hot-encoded column names throughout a pipeline❓

For this recap, you can choose between two options:

Option 1 : `Custom One-Hot-Encoder correction (~ 30min) + Q&A with teacher`

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/<program.challenges_repo_name>/05-ML/08-Workflow/07-Custom-Encoder
jupyter notebook custom_encoder.ipynb
```

Option 2 : `Bonus - The cars' dataset preprocessor with column names (1h)`

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/<program.challenges_repo_name>/05-ML/08-Workflow/06-Bonus
jupyter notebook cars_dataset_full_pipeline.ipynb
```

* In these two challenges, you will discover how to keep track of the columns' names through a Pipeline!
* The first option is fully focused on preserving the columns' names in a Pipeline
* The second option is more comprehensive, showing you how to design a preprocessing Pipeline from A to Z
