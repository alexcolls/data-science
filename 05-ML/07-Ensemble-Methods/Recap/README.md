In this recap, the teacher will:
1. First, go through the solution for House Kaggle Competition
2. Show you a packaged version of the challenge `houses_trainer_package`

You will be able to download both of them from Kitt after the recap from the challenge page. Keep them as reference for a clean template of data-science project in the future!
