# Playground

The first exercise is an gentle introduction to Deep Learning. Thanks to the Tensorflow playground, a site that emulates a neural network, you will get a better intuition of the operations that are going on in a neural network. It is also intended to give you a visual representation of neural networks that will ease your comprehension for the rest of the week.

Start the `playground.ipynb` notebook with `jupyter notebook`.

⚠️ Disclaimer: for many Deep Challenges, it is advisable to work with `Google Colab`, which is like an online Jupyter Notebook.

For this first challenge, you don't need Colab yet. 

However, feel free to read our tutorial [here](https://kitt.lewagon.com/knowledge/tutorials/data_google_colab) if you want to get familiar with Colab. You may want to use it for the challenge `House Kaggle Competition Bis` and the next chapters of Deep Learning.
