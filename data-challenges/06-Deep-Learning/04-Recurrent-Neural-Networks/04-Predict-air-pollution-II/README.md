### Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 4 - Predict air pollution - Part II

In this exercise, you will have sequences of weather features. You will predict the air pollution that corresponds to each day within the sequence.


Contrary to the previous exercise, you are not given the pollution values each day but you have to predict them. Moreover, you will deal with a bit more complex data as the sequences will be of different lengths.
