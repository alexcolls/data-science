### Finalize your analysis

Continue working on yesterday's `ceo-request.ipynb` notebook as needed

🚀 Feel free to copy paste into your existing `seller.py` and `product.py` the updated content from the solutions `seller_updated_solution.py` and `product_updated_solution.py` available to download from yesterday's recap challenge. They contain `profits_per_seller` and `profits_per_product`.

### Present your analysis at 5pm
