    "> VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition”. The model achieves 92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet, which is a dataset of over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes. It was one of the famous model submitted to ILSVRC-2014. It makes the improvement over AlexNet by replacing large kernel-sized filters (11 and 5 in the first and second convolutional layer, respectively) with multiple 3×3 kernel-sized filters one after another. VGG16 was trained for weeks and was using NVIDIA Titan Black GPU’s.\n",

    ">_Once your model has converged on the new data, you can try to unfreeze all or part of the base model and retrain the whole model end-to-end with a very low learning rate. This is an optional last step that can potentially give you incremental improvements. It could also potentially lead to quick overfitting -- keep that in mind. It is critical to only do this step after the model with frozen layers has been trained to convergence. If you mix randomly-initialized trainable layers with trainable layers that hold pre-trained features, the randomly-initialized layers will cause very large gradient updates during training, which will destroy your pre-trained features. It's also critical to use a very low learning rate at this stage, because you are training a much larger model than in the first round of training, on a dataset that is typically very small. As a result, you are at risk of overfitting very quickly if you apply large weight updates. Here, you only want to readapt the pretrained weights in an incremental way._\n",
